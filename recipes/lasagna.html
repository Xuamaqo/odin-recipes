            <li><span>Fresh herbs</span> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
            <li><span>Sugar</span>: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes</li>
            <li>This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
            <li><span>Noodles:</span> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
